# Shopping Stats 

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to have my family add to a shopping list, that I can check off items as they are purchased.
- As a user, I want to be able to see statistics about my shopping habits, such as most frequently purchased items and total spending over time.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how long it has been since I last purchased an item, so I can better plan my shopping trips.
- As a user, I want to be able to break down my shopping spending to categories, like stores, item types, and time periods.
- As a user, I want to be able to access my shopping list from my IPhone offline so that I can use it even without internet access.


## Features

- Shared Shopping List: A collaborative shopping list that multiple family members can add to and check off items.
- A history log of purchased items with timestamps.
- Offline Access: Ability to access and modify the shopping list without an internet connection, with changes syncing when back online.
- Must be compatible with iPhone devices.
- Must be a PWA or other format that allows offline access on iPhone without the App Store.

## Developer Expectations

- As an AI developer, I expect you to use the terminal outputs to confirm your code is working as expected.
- As an AI developer, I expect you to create a core logic API that can be used by a CLI for your testing, and the front end PWA for user interaction.
- As an AI developer, I expect you to use a testing framework that I can run locally on my computer. I will use web dev tools to simulated an IPhone environment for testing the PWA.
