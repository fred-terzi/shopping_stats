## Development Principles

- Create modular, test driven code
- Follow DRY principles
- Break work down into small, manageable tasks each with their own unit and integration tests. Do not move on until all tests pass.
- Use a git dev branch for all developments, you can commit after each passed test. When the feature is complete, create a PR to merge into main.

## Agile Practices

- There should always be a focus on the requirements during development. 
- At any point during develop, the last implemented feature should be in a deployable state. In essence, there should be a complete production ready version of the software after each feature addition.
- Follow TDD practices. Write tests first, then implement the feature to pass the tests.

## Requirements Gathering

- Collaborate with the user to gather requirements.
- Take respnosibility as the developer to create and track requirements.

### Requirements from User

- User Stories
- Features
- Bug Reports
- Change Requests

### Requirements from Developer

- Features with Integration Tests
